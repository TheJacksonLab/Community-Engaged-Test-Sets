# Community-Engaged-Test-Sets
We introduce a generalizable mode of scientific outreach that couples a published study to a community-engaged test set, enabling post-publication evaluation by the broader ML community. This approach is demonstrated using a prior study on AI-guided discovery of photostable light-harvesting small molecules (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07892-1">Closed-loop transfer enables artificial intelligence to yield chemical knowledge</a>, <a href="https://github.com/TheJacksonLab/ClosedLoopTransfer/tree/main">GitHub Repository</a>). After publishing an experimental dataset and in-house ML models, we leveraged automated block chemistry to synthesize nine additional light-harvesting molecules to serve as a blinded community test set. We then hosted an open Kaggle competition (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/molecular-machine-learning">Molecular Data Machine Learning</a>) where we challenged the world community to outperform our best in-house predictive photostability model.

# Dataset
Our data was collected in house using automated modular block synthesis and automated characterization. We had a training set of 42 light-harvesting small molecules and a test set of 7 molecules. For each molecule in the dataset, we provided 144 chemical features calculated from RDKit and TDDFT as well as the corresponding SMILES string.
